				<h3>PORTAL&nbsp; </h3>
		    <p>The portal was by far the crowning achievement of the site. Because of the multi-media approach to the site, newgrounds incentivized and enabled collaboration between artists and creators. The portal was a catch-all term for the creative union of all of the various artforms present on the site. Some of the site's most popular content, usually games or giant flash animation collab videos, were worked on by numerous people, becoming some of the most ambitious projects worked on by artists from all across the globe. Creators would be listed on the videos with their contributions, from code to original music, and helped launch the careers of talented users. 
 </p>
		   	
				<p>Some of the most popular works became their own separate projects that found commercial success, most famously, Fulp and Dan Paladin’s Alien Hominid, which was packaged and sold digitally on the Xbox Live Arcade in 2004. The game proved successful and was followed up by 2008’s Castle Crasher’s, which has sold over two million copies. The team for these games was composed of friends and users of the site. </p>
